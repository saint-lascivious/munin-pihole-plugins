[Munin](https://munin-monitoring.org) [plugins](https://gallery.munin-monitoring.org) and management script for monitoring various [Pi-hole®](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole) statistics. Transforms a server into a powerful monitoring platform, as simple as [one](https://github.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins#step-one-download), [two](https://github.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins#step-two-install), […three](https://github.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins#step-three-wait), [four](https://github.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins#step-four-monitor).

## Quick Start

### Step One: Download

```

### Step Two: Install
* Install munin-pihole-plugins
```
./munin-pihole-plugins --install
```
Dependencies are checked and met automatically using `dpkg-query` and `apt` respectively. A copy of the `munin-pihole-plugins` script will be installed on the host in `/usr/local/bin` by default. The munin-pihole-plugins script directory can be [configured](https://github.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins/wiki/Configuration#script_dir), or the `munin-pihole-plugins` script installation may be [disabled entirely](https://github.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins/wiki/Configuration#install_script).
