# Quick Start

## Step One: Download
* Download munin-pihole-plugins `development` branch
```
curl -sSL munin-pihole-plugins-dev.sainternet.xyz -o munin-pihole-plugins && chmod +x munin-pihole-plugins
```

Or,

* Download munin-pihole-plugins `master` branch
```
curl -sSL munin-pihole-plugins.sainternet.xyz -o munin-pihole-plugins && chmod +x munin-pihole-plugins
```

## Step Two: Install
* Install munin-pihole-plugins
```
./munin-pihole-plugins --install
```
Dependencies are checked and met automatically using `dpkg-query` and `apt` respectively. A copy of the `munin-pihole-plugins` script will be installed on the host in `/usr/local/bin` by default. The munin-pihole-plugins script directory can be [configured](https://github.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins/wiki/Configuration#script_dir), or the `munin-pihole-plugins` script installation may be [disabled entirely](https://github.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins/wiki/Configuration#install_script).

## Step Three: …Wait
* Wait, around five minutes

While graphs are generated by the Munin master on demand, Munin nodes run their plugins periodically, by default at 5 minute intervals past the hour.

## Step Four: Monitor
* Navigate to `http://YOUR_NEW_MUNIN_SERVER'S_FQDN,_HOSTNAME,_OR_IP/munin` in a browser to view the Munin monitoring interface
