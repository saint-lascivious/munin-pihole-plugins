# munin-pihole-plugins

[Munin](https://munin-monitoring.org) [plugins](https://gallery.munin-monitoring.org) and management script for monitoring various [Pi-hole®](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole) statistics. Transforms a server into a powerful monitoring platform, as simple as [one](https://github.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins#step-one-download), [two](https://github.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins#step-two-install), [three](https://github.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins#step-three-wait), …[four](https://github.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins#step-four-monitor).

## Usage

### Step One: Download
* Download munin-pihole-plugins `development` branch
```
curl -sSL munin-pihole-plugins-dev.sainternet.xyz -o munin-pihole-plugins && chmod +x munin-pihole-plugins
```

### Step Two: Install
* Install munin-pihole-plugins
```
./munin-pihole-plugins --install
```
Dependencies are checked and met automatically using `dpkg-query` and `apt` respectively. A copy of the `munin-pihole-plugins` script will be installed on the host in `/usr/local/bin` by default. The munin-pihole-plugins script directory can be [configured](https://github.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins#script-configuration), or the `munin-pihole-plugins` script installation may be disabled entirely.

### Step Three: …Wait
* Wait, around five minutes

While graphs are generated by the Munin master on-demand using cgi graph strategy, Munin nodes run plugins periodically, by default at 5 minute intervals past the hour. Check out the [command list](https://github.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins#command-list) while you wait.

### Step Four: Monitor
* Navigate to http://MUNIN_SERVER_FQDN_HOSTNAME_OR_IP/munin in a browser to view the Munin monitoring interface

If everything went well, you should find [munin-pihole-plugins graphs](https://github.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins#example-graph-gallery) available to view in the 'dns' category. Otherwise, see the [help section](https://github.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins#help-my-graphs-arent-showing-up).

## Configuration

### Plugin Configuration
* Default `/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/pihole.conf` plugin configuration
```
[pihole_*]
    user root
    env.host 127.0.0.1
    env.port 80
    env.api /admin/api.php
    env.cachesuffix ?getCacheInfo&auth=
    #env.webpassword PIHOLE_SETUPVARS_WEBPASSWORD_HERE
```
Provided munin-node and Pi-hole® exist on the same host, the default configuration should Just Work™. If you have a non-standard configuration or Pi-hole® is running on a seperate host, you will need to edit the plugin configuration. The plugin attempts to obtain this value itself, if it can not do so the `env.webpassword` value can be obtained from the Pihole host's `/etc/pihole/setupVars.conf` file.

### Script Configuration
* Usage

Initial installation, or without the `munin-pihole-plugins` script being locally installed: `export VARIABLE="VALUE"`

Example: `export VERBOSITY_LEVEL="4"`

Subsequent runs, with the `munin-pihole-plugins` script locally installed: `munin-pihole-plugins --variables VARIABLE VALUE`

Example: `munin-pihole-plugins --variables VERBOSITY_LEVEL 4`

Reset example: `munin-pihole-plugins --variables VERBOSITY_LEVEL RESET`

The `/etc/munin-pihole-plugins/munin-pihole-plugins.conf` file may be manually created and placed ahead of time if desired, useful for packaging or other automated deployment. This file MUST be a plain text file and MUST consist of the format `VARIABLE=VALUE`, one variable per line, with no leading whitespace or indentation.
