# munin-pihole-plugins

[Munin](https://munin-monitoring.org) [plugins](https://gallery.munin-monitoring.org) and management script for monitoring various [Pi-hole®](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole) statistics. Transforms a server into a powerful monitoring platform, as simple as [one](https://github.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins#step-one-download), [two](https://github.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins#step-two-install), [three](https://github.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins#step-three-wait), ...[four](https://github.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins#step-four-monitor).

## Step One: Download
* Download munin-pihole-plugins
```
curl -sSL munin-pihole-plugins.sainternet.xyz -o munin-pihole-plugins && chmod +x munin-pihole-plugins
```

## Step Two: Install
* Install munin-pihole-plugins
```
./munin-pihole-plugins --install
```
Dependencies are checked and met using `dpkg-query` and `apt` respectively, you will be prompted before any unmet dependencies are installed. A copy of the `munin-pihole-plugins` script will be installed on the host in `/usr/local/bin` by default. The munin-pihole-plugins script directory can be configured, or the `munin-pihole-plugins` script installation may be disabled entirely.

## Step Three: Wait
* Wait, around five minutes

While graphs are generated by the Munin master on-demand using cgi graph strategy, Munin nodes run plugins periodically, by default at 5 minute intervals past the hour. Check out the [full help text](https://github.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins#full-help-text) while you wait.

## Step Four: Monitor
* Navigate to http://MUNIN_SERVER_FQDN_HOSTNAME_OR_IP/munin in a browser to view the Munin monitoring interface

If everything went well, you should find [munin-pihole-plugins graphs](https://github.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins#example-graph-gallery) available to view in the 'dns' category. Otherwise, see the [help section](https://github.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins#help-my-graphs-arent-showing-up).

## Plugin Configuration
* Default `/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/pihole.conf` plugin configuration
```
[pihole_*]
    user root
    env.host 127.0.0.1
    env.port 80
    env.api /admin/api.php
    env.cachesuffix ?getCacheInfo&auth=
    #env.webpassword PIHOLE_SETUPVARS_WEBPASSWORD_HERE
```
Provided munin-node and Pi-hole® exist on the same host, the default configuration should Just Work. If you have a non-standard configuration or Pi-hole® is running on a seperate host, you will need to edit the plugin configuration. The `env.webpassword` value can be obtained from the Pihole host's `/etc/pihole/setupVars.conf` file. The plugins attempt to obtain this value themselves.

## Script Configuration
* Default `munin-pihole-plugins` script environment variables
```
Usage: export [VARIABLE]="value"

Variable
  DNS_PORT="53"
  DNS_SERVER="208.67.222.222"

  MUNIN_PLUGIN_DIR="/usr/share/munin/plugins"
  NODE_PLUGIN_DIR="/etc/munin/plugins"
  PLUGIN_CONFIG_DIR="/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d"
  PLUGIN_LIST="blocked cache cache_by_type clients percent queries replies_by_type status unique_domains"
  PROXY_CONFIG_DIR="/etc/lighttpd"
  SCRIPT_DIR="{SCRIPT_DIR:-/usr/local/bin}"
  SKIP_DEPENDENCY_CHECK="false"
  UPDATE_SELF="true"
  VERBOSE_OUTPUT="true"
```

* `DNS_PORT`

The port which the `munin-pihole-plugins` script will contact in order to contact `DNS_SERVER`.

* `DNS_SERVER`

The DNS server which the `munin-pihole-plugins` script will contact in order to retrieve its version information (from a `TXT` record at `munin-pihole-plugins.sainternet.xyz`). This should ideally be an IP rather than a hostname, and it should ideally be external, but I'm not your mother.

* `INSTALL_PLUGINS`

Disables installation of `munin-node` and `munin-pihole-plugins` plugins if set to any value other than `true`.

* `INSTALL_SCRIPT`

Disables installation of the `munin-pihole-plugins` script if set to any value other than `true`.

* `INSTALL_WEBSERVER`

Disables installation of the `munin` webserver and `lighttpd` proxy if set to any value other than `true`. Useful for additional Munin nodes in a multi-node, single-server environment.

* `MUNIN_DIR`

The directory in which the `munin` munin.conf file should be located.

* `MUNIN_CONFIG_DIR`

The directory in which additional `munin` configuration files may be placed, the `munin-pihole-plugins` script will attempt to use this in favour of editing munin.conf directly.

* `MUNIN_PLUGIN_DIR`

The directory in which `munin` plugins should be located.

* `NODE_PLUGIN_DIR`

The directory in which `munin-node` symbolic links should be created.

* `PLUGIN_CONFIG_DIR`

The directory in which individual `munin-node` plugin configurations should be located.

* `PLUGIN_LIST`

A space separated list of `munin-pihole-plugins` plugin names used to determine which plugins will be installed.

* `PROXY_CONFIG_DIR`

The directory in which `'lighttpd`'s external.conf should be located.

* `SCRIPT_DIR`

The directory in which the `munin-pihole-plugins` script should be located when installed, the `munin-pihole-plugins` script will warn if this directory is not located in the host's $PATH variable and suggest how to correct this.

* `SKIP_DEPENDENCY_CHECK`

Disables `apt` and `dpkg-query` based dependency satisfaction if set to any value other than `false`.

* `UPDATE_SELF`

Disables self update of the `munin-pihole-plugins` script if set to any value other than `true`.

* `VERBOSE_OUTPUT`

Disables non-critical `munin-pihole-plugins` script output if set to any value other than `true`. Errors are always displayed, but a successful installation will be otherwise silent.

## Help! My graphs aren't showing up!

* Be patient

Graphs should be generated at five minute intervals. If you still do not see graphs after this time, try restarting the machine and waiting a further five minutes. If you still can not get any graphs to display, [contact me](https://github.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins#contact) for further support.
